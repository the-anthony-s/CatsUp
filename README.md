Thank you for the project.

The idea was to create a Rails app separated from the `front-end` similarly to Airbnb or Netflix logic, using Rails on the `back-end` and React on the `front-end`.


## JSON response wrapper

You can notice that in all controllers, I use the `json_response` method. It's a wrapper that separates the JSON render logic. Ideally, I would use the Netflix approach; more information here: https://anmagpie.medium.com/rails-api-with-fastjson-from-netflix-e7bf4f4e5e7b . It will speed up the back-end process and help the servers to work more efficient.

More information about `json_response` method: https://github.com/the-anthony-s/CatsUp/blob/master/app/controllers/concerns/response.rb


## Tests

I use `RSpec` with `Redis`, `FactoryBot (aka FactoryGirl)`, and `DatabaseCleaner`. More information here:

## Few words on which features were selected and why?

My goal was to focus on the core features of the web-chat application, such as messaging between users, adding and modifying channels, creating messages and updating them. In my opinion, these functions are the most important for the user.

Selected features:
1. As a consumer of the API, I can persist my chat messages
2. As a consumer of the API, I can persist messages in specific channels I join.
3. As a consumer of the API, I can see the List of all the available channels
4. As a consumer of the API, I can look up other users and channels
5. As a consumer of the API, I can see chat statistics of users and channels (partially)


## What's next?

1. Add better fields validations. For example, `email` format. Or even better would be to create an actual authentication model with `devise` gem and modify it to user `JSON tocken`.
2. Add option to make channels private or public.
3. Add sorting through `url` params. Example: `http://localhost:3000/users?region=params[:region]&time=params[:time]`
4. Add more statistics for each model (Region, IP address, Count private accounts, etc.)
5. Add `FastJSON` to serialize JSON responses (better performance)
6. Add the front-end part as a separate project.


- Add caching -> Memcached
- Throttling by IP address, by API key, control it per path or action, etc.
